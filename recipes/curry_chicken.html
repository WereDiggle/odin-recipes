    Bring takeout taste home by making Chinese curry chicken in your kitchen. It's brimming with tender chicken and
    crisp veggies in a cheerful bright yellow curry sauce. <strong>Gluten-Free Adaptable</strong>

    To make the dish gluten-free, use dry sherry instead of Shaoxing wine. Also make sure the oyster sauce you use is
    gluten-free.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 (12 oz / 340 g) chicken breast , thinly sliced against the grain into 1/4” (5mm) thick pieces
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Marinade</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      1/4 teaspoon salt
    </li>
    <li>
      1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
    </li>
    <li>
      1 tablespoon cornstarch
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Spice Mix</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder (*Footnote 1)
    </li>
    <li>
      1 teaspoon turmeric powder
    </li>
    <li>
      1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes depending on spice level (Optional)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Stir Fry</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil (or vegetable oil)</li>
    <li>1/2 large white onion , chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 ” (1 cm) ginger , minced</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper , chopped</li>
    <li>1 carrot , sliced</li>
    <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons oyster sauce</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine the chicken, salt, Shaoxing wine, and cornstarch in a medium-sized bowl. Mix to coat the chicken evenly
      and set aside.</li>
    <li>Add oil to a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat until hot. Add the onions and stir fry for 1 minute.
    </li>
    <li>Add the ginger, pepper, carrot, and spice mix. Cook and stir until the vegetables are beginning to soften, about
      2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour in the chicken broth. Add the sugar, salt, and oyster sauce. Stir to mix well and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>Turn to medium-low heat to bring the broth to a low simmer. Add the marinated chicken with minimal overlapping.
      Use your spatula to separate any pieces that are stuck together. Simmer for 2 minutes, or until the slices of
      chicken are just cooked through and the sauce is slightly thickened. (*Footnote 2)</li>
    <li>Transfer everything to a big plate. Serve hot over rice as a main dish.</li>
